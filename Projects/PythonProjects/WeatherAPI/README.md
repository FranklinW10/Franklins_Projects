This was a project in which I got data from a website called, openweathermap.org, using an api key.

I then used this data to create differnt visuals to display the upcoming weather forcast.

Using dash I created a dropdown menu that allowed the uses to select which aspect of the weather they would like to see the forcast for.

The API key is out of date, but with an updated one the code still runs smoothly.
